 CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of your HTML document.  CSS makes your websites look like they do. Without CSS our websites would look very plain and basic. Some examples of what is styled with CSS are fonts, colors, backgrounds, links, headers, buttons, etc. . CSS selectors like element selectors, class and ID selectors are what is used to select the HTML elements. With CSS you can either inject your styles internally or externally(usually preferred).  Going the internal stylesheet route you can place the style tag in between the head tags and  place in your CSS code. This could be a good way to go if you are only looking to style one page or a small website. For the external stylesheet route you would create a seperate file for your CSS and save it with a .css extension. You would then link the CSS file to your HTML page with the link tag. Using this external stylesheet method is much more popular beacuse it's better for organization, easier maintenance,  more flexibility, etc. . The third and probably the least popular method would be inline styles where you place your CSS style=" " inside the HTML elements that you want to style. One important thing to keep in mind with CSS is it will often get rendered differently on seperate browsers, though there are ways to make your CSS cross compatible across most browsers such as using seperate stylesheets for different browsers, using certain frameworks and validating your code on sites like [w3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
