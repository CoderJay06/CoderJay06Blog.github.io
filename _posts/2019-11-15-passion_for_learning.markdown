I've discovered my passion for learning and programming. Most of my life I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do for a career until now. About a year ago I decided I was going to do something in tech, the question was what.  I started studying towards a different field in tech (Cybersecurity) until i came across some free programming content online that caught my interest. I took my first programming courses in Python and computer science on learning platforms like Codecademy, Treehouse and Mooc's(Massive Open Online Courses) such as Couresea, Udacity and edx.

I was hooked and decided I want to start pursuing this new career path into software development. After taking multiple courses, tutorials, reading books etc. trying to learn as much as I can, I realized I wasn't getting too far on my own. I was trying to learn to code more then actually "learning to code".  After looking into multiple schools and bootcamps that offer training in software development I eventually found Flatiron school and I'm very happy I did. So far my experience here has been great and I feel like I've learned more in just a couple of weeks than in the several months teaching myself. I'm glad to to be apart of this community full of people passionate about programming and to be starting my journey to become a developer here. I ended up choosing to learn software development because I love the challenge of it and I feel it's more of an *art than a science*.
